# Text Classification (Sentence level)

Experiments on sentence classification. Task-Independent Model Wrapper. 

## Task-independent Model Wrapper

A supervised learning project commonly has the following modules:

* Dataset module
* Model defining, or graph defining module
* Training, validation, prediction procedures

The train/valid/pred procedures for supervised learnings are much the same for different tasks, so I tried to implement the model wrapper to be task-independent. Then one can focus on data preprocessing and model construction jobs.

## Models

* CNN
* CNN-RNF
* RNN + Attention-Pooling
* CNN + Self-Matching

## Description

To run this repo:

1, python data_set.py

2, python script_train_cnn.py
