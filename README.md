# Task-Independent Model Wrapper

Task-Independent Model Wrapper. Experiments on sentence classification.

## Task-independent

A supervised learning project commonly has the following modules:

* Dataset module
* Model defining, or graph defining module
* Training, validation, prediction procedures

The train/valid/pred procedures for supervised learnings are much the same for different tasks, so I tried to implement the model wrapper to be task-independent. Then one can focus on data preprocessing and model construction jobs.

## Models

* CNN
* RNN + Attention-Pooling
* CNN + Self-Matching
